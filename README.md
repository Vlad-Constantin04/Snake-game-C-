I made Snake game in C++. This game involves controlling a snake on a grid and trying to eat food while avoiding collisions with the walls and itself. 

Include Statements: The code includes several C++ standard libraries like iostream, windows.h, fstream, etc., which provide functionalities for input/output, handling the console window, file input/output, and more.

Struct Definition (tailpos): A structure tailpos is defined to represent the coordinates of a part of the snake. It includes the x and y coordinates, as well as pointers to the next and previous parts of the snake.

snake Class: This class represents the game logic and contains various member functions to manage the game:

Constructor (snake()): Initializes various game parameters like the score, the positions of the snake, food, walls, and console handling.

insert(int x, int y): Inserts a new part of the snake at a specified position (used when the snake eats food).

move(): Handles the movement of the snake based on the current direction (d) and updates the positions of the snake's body parts.

draw(): Draws the snake and the score on the console window.

drawWall(): Draws the walls of the game area on the console window.

drawfood(int x): Draws food on the screen, and if x is 1, it generates new food coordinates (used when the snake eats the food).

drawinit(): Initializes the game by drawing the walls.

collision(): Checks for collisions between the snake and itself, the food, or the walls. Returns true if a collision occurs.

labelDead(): Displays a message when the player loses the game.

loop(snake &ob): This function controls the game loop. It initializes the snake's initial position, draws the game's walls, and then enters a loop where it continuously updates the game state. It checks for collisions, handles keyboard input for changing the snake's direction, and moves the snake accordingly. When a collision occurs, it displays a game over message.

main(): The main function is the entry point of the program. It initializes the game by creating an instance of the snake class and displays the game menu. Depending on the user's input, it either starts the game loop (loop(obc)), displays the help menu, or exits the program.
